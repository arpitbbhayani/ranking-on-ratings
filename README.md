Ranking on Ratings
---

Given [MovieLens dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) we rank movies using following aggregation strategies

 - Arithmetic Average
 - Artihmetic Average with number of reviews
 - Cumulative Rating
 - Bayesian Average

A detail blog post has been compiled on the findings; and you can find it at [Solving an age-old problem with Bayesian Average](https://arpitbhayani.me/blogs/bayesian-average).
